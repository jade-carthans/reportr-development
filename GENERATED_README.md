## Overview

The **tests** repository contains a small collection of files primarily focused on testing or data representation. It includes a JSON file and a Python script, potentially related to testing scenarios or configurations.

Due to the limited context and absence of explicit documentation, this repository appears to serve as a basic or experimental workspace for test-related code or data in JSON and Python formats.

## Repository Contents

- `random_test_file.json` — A JSON file, likely containing data or configuration for testing.
- `random_test_file.py` — A Python script, possibly used to perform tests or process the JSON data.

## Usage

Since no specific instructions or dependencies are provided, usage details are currently undefined. You may review the Python script and JSON file to understand their purpose and adapt them to your needs.

### Running the Python Script

If you want to execute the Python script, ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x recommended). Then run:

```bash
python random_test_file.py
```

No external dependencies are indicated, so no additional setup is required.

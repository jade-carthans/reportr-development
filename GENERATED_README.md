# Python Reporting Toolkit

A modular Python project providing features for generating README files, progress reports, and summaries through reusable components.

## Key Features

- Generate detailed README files programmatically
- Create general and user-specific progress reports
- Summarize project details and overviews from prompts
- Organized modular structure under `features/` for extensibility
- Simple dependency management via `requirements.txt`

## Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Import and use feature modules as needed, for example:

```python
from features.generate_readme.generate_readme import generate_readme
readme_content = generate_readme()
print(readme_content)
```

Refer to individual modules in the `features/` directory for more functionality.
